## Data Model In Salesforce Sales Cloud

<img src="https://architect.salesforce.com/1/asset/immutable/s/a86a100/assets/images/data-models/sales-cloud-opportunity-forecasting-data-model.png" alt="Data Model of Salesforce Forecast"/>

## The supported Data Source Objects which Sales Cloud Forecasting is based on
- Opportunity (API Name: Opportunity)
- Opportunity Product (API Name: OpportunityLineItem)
- Opportunity Split (API Name: OpportunityLineItemSplit)
- Line Item Schedule (API Name: OpportunityLineItemSchedule)

> **Notes:** The forecasting is centered on Opportunity (The source data the forecasting based on is either Opportunity or Opportunity related data ) , so creating a data culture is the critical important  for a Company to successfully rolling out the Sales Cloud forecast.

## Two types of hierarchy that Sales Cloud Forecasting supports to group 
- User role (role-based forecasts hierarchy is automatically generated based on your `Role Hierarchy`)
- Territory (territory-based forecasts hierarchy is relied on the Enterprise `Territory Models` , need enable Enterprise Territory Management first ).

> **Notes:** For role-based forecasts hierarchy,  users must be in the role-based forecasts hierarchy within their respective roles and also a user in the role-based forecasts hierarchy must be selected  to act as the forecast manager to be able to view subordinatesâ€™ forecasts.

## Forecast categories

**Notes:** Based on forecast period (monthly or quarterly) and Opportunity Stage, Sales Cloud accumulates the forcasts data into Categories: `Pipeline`, `Best Case`, `Commit`, `Closed`, `Omitted`.
