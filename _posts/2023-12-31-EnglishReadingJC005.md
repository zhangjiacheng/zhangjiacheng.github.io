## Words
dull 沉闷的
flavourless 无味的
hydration 水分
sluggish 疲倦
excess 过量的
decent 充足的，得体的


## Key Sentences
Water is dull, flavourless and just so unexciting.
But it is brilliant at keeping us hydrated, and you should be drinking eight 8-ounce glassses of it a day.

Without adequate hydration, we often feel hungry, sluggish, and tired.
This can cause us to miss workouts, snack on unhealthy food, and reach for excess caffeine.

Gym access may be difficult. Incorporate bodyweight movements such as squats, lunges, shoulder taps, and burpees, and take your fitness on the road with you.
